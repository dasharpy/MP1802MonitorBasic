MP1802MonitorBasic is a monitor and BASIC language style interpreter for the RCA 1802 cpu.  My earlier development
iterations began around 1980 for the COSMAC Elf style micro.  Recently, I have resurrected the original code
and have made numerous changes.  Current code is being developed using the A18 1802 cross-assembler (version 2.5).
It is targeted to fit on a 27128 EPROM.  Testing of code has beem performed using EMMA 02 emulator.  This code is
a continuous work-in-progress.  See comments within assembly code for more details on development and usage.
